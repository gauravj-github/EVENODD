Here's a breakdown of your Python code:

### Code:
```python
a = 2

if a % 2 == 0:
    print("number is even", a)
else:
    print("number is odd", a)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`a = 2`**: The variable `a` is assigned the value 2.
2. **`if a % 2 == 0`**: This checks if the remainder of `a` when divided by 2 is zero (i.e., if the number is even).
   - **If true**, it prints "number is even" followed by the value of `a`.
   - **Else**, it prints "number is odd" followed by the value of `a`.

### Output:
Since `a = 2`, the output will be:
```
number is even 2
```
